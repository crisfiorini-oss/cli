// --- Delivery Jobs ---
//
// A module manifest declares; a delivery Job delivers. The manifest a render
// writes is desired state Argo keeps true in the cluster, and nothing more:
// the host learns of a generation when its delivery API is POSTed the signed
// carrier, which is what this Job does. One Job per module tree, run in the
// module's own namespace — the namespace of the manifest's workloads, the one
// the host authorizes the carrier in — as the `delivery` ServiceAccount,
// POSTs every manifest carrier the tree delivers, a withdrawal included.
//
// The Jobs are Argo CD Sync hooks rather than tracked resources, on purpose. A
// tracked Job is applied once and, being Complete, never re-synced: restore the
// host's database to before a generation and the applied state is gone while
// nothing re-POSTs it. A hook runs on every sync of the Application, from state
// that still exists — the ConfigMaps — so a replay after a restore is an
// ordinary `argocd app sync`, and a sync that changes nothing else re-POSTs a
// generation the host answers "current" to. BeforeHookCreation deletes a hook
// of the SAME NAME before creating it again; the Job's name carries its set's
// content, so a changed set is a new name, and completed Jobs of earlier
// generations accumulate until an operator prunes them — retention this
// renderer does not do.
//
// Reachability is a retry, not a sync wave. A per-module Application cannot
// express "after the host's delivery API is reachable", because the host is
// another module's Application; so the Job retries a transport failure or a
// 5xx with backoff until the API answers, inside its budget. What the wave
// orders is narrower: the Job lives in the module-manifests Application
// beside the ConfigMaps it mounts and the ServiceAccount it runs as, which sit at the default wave, and is annotated one wave later so it
// runs once they exist. Where a parent syncs the module's Applications by
// wave, that Application lands beside the module's consumers (after its
// bootstrap units) — neither waits for the other — except for the module
// that serves the delivery API itself, whose delivery follows its units; see
// deliveryWaveFor. The Applications an ApplicationSet stamps otherwise sync
// independently, and no real readiness model has run this ordering.
//
// A terminal answer — a stale or rewritten generation (409), a document the
// host refuses (422), a carrier it does not accept (401, 403) — fails the Job,
// and with it the sync, so a refused delivery is visible where it happened
// rather than discovered when a solution never appears.

// the budget is spent — so a document the host keeps failing never keeps a
// later one, a tombstone among them, from its first attempt. Every request
