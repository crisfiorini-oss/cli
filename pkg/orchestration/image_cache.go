// The image build cache answers one question: would building this recipe again
// produce the same image? A configuration edit re-renders a module and reaches
// the image build for every one of its services, and an image build is minutes
// each, so a change that touches nothing an image is built from must keep the
// digest it already has instead of paying for a rebuild that cannot differ.
//
// It is content-addressed in the literal sense: the key is a digest over the
// bytes that go into the image — every file of the build context, the verified
// recipe tree, and the exact buildx invocation — never over a declaration that
// summarises them. A dependency manifest, a lock file or a tree digest recorded
// by something else states what the inputs are *supposed* to be; only the bytes
// state what they are. Keying on a manifest is how a cache serves a stale
// binary for a source edit in a language whose manifest did not move: the edit
// is real, the key does not move, and neither the image digest nor the artifact
// itself shows anything wrong. So a source file that changes by one byte
// changes the context digest, and therefore the key, whether or not any
// manifest changed.
//
// Everything the cache cannot account for makes it decline rather than guess: a
// plan with no verified tree digest, a context it cannot walk, an ignore file it
// cannot parse, and a recorded image the container engine or registry can no
// longer produce all fall through to a build.
//
// Two inputs a build reads that are not plain context files are bound
// explicitly, because each is a way an image can change while every context
// byte stays put.
//
// A recipe declaring Go module downloads is built against a module proxy the
// plan phase fetched into a per-run directory (goModulePrefetch), whose path is
// normalized out of the key. What the build reads out of that proxy is decided
// by the go.mod and go.sum of each declared module root, so those files are
// hashed directly, by path, outside the ignore policy. Hashing them only as part
// of the context would not do: the prefetch reads them off the filesystem, where
// no ignore policy applies, so a policy that excluded them would drop a real
// input from the key while the prefetch still acted on it. With the manifests
// bound, the proxy's contents follow from them — the module cache verifies every
// downloaded version against go.sum's content hashes, and -mod=readonly makes a
// version missing from go.sum fail the fetch instead of being written in. A
// filesystem `replace` resolves to a directory rather than the proxy, and the
// build can only read that directory if it is in the context, where it is hashed
// like any other file. A recipe declaring git sources is handed a mirror
// directory the same way, normalized out of the key the same way; the
// repositories and commits it holds are the declaration's, which the recipe
// tree digest covers.
//
// A base image is resolved, not taken from its name. A recipe that says
// `FROM golang:1.25` is built from whatever manifest that tag points at when the
// build runs, and the tag is re-pushed whenever the base is patched, so the
// Dockerfile text alone binds the base's *name* and not the base. Each external
// reference is resolved to its manifest digest and the digest goes in the key;
// a reference that cannot be resolved declines the recipe, so a build runs
// rather than reusing an image whose base may have moved underneath it.
//
// What is NOT bound, and cannot be by a digest over inputs: whatever a build
// step fetches from the network itself. A `RUN` that installs from a mutable
// package index reads bytes no input names, so reuse means "the image built from
// these inputs", not "the image a build today would produce". Docker's own layer
// cache has the same property.
