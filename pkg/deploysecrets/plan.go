// Package deploysecrets derives what an environment's secret store must hold for
// a rendered environment to materialize, and writes it: `codefly deploy
// secrets`.
//
// A render never carries a secret value. It names, in each service's projected
// ExternalSecret, the remote key and property every secret it reads resolves
// from, and leaves the store to hold them. This package reads those names back
// from the render and resolves each one to a source, in order:
//
//  1. keep — the store already holds it; a value is never rotated here;
//  2. propagate — a configuration value is one value however many services read
//     it, so a key another remote secret already holds is copied from there;
//  3. generate — a key the environment's `service-secrets.generate` declares
//     random;
//  4. require — anything else is supplied from outside, and named.
//
// Every one of those resolutions is named by the SECRET KEY the render reads —
// the CODEFLY__… name core gives a configuration value — never by the property
// the environment files that key under. The two are the same string only when an
// environment happens to file a key under its own name; one that maps keys to
// human-named properties (`property: postgres_user`) makes them differ for every
// key it maps, and resolving by the property then matches no shared
// configuration value and no declared generator. Each of those is a value the
// system derives, reported instead as one to type by hand.
//
// Values never leave the package: a plan reports property names, the keys read
// from them and sources only, and the writes it carries are unexported.
